# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately rather than opening a public issue.

**Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/b0j3ng4/kite-vscode-extension/security/advisories/new)** to submit a private report. This allows maintainers to triage and fix the issue before it is disclosed publicly.

For more information, see [GitHub's documentation on privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
